Miscellaneous data visualizations (R + ggplot2)

**Abundance Box Plots**
* Box plots for genus abundances across all sequences
* Box plots grouped by host identity (family and species) 


**Amplicon Bar Charts**
* Bar charts for coverage and number of high-quality sequences (with a bar for each amplicon type)
* Stacked bar charts for bacterial and fungal taxa broken down by sample
* Single bar chart of pooled data across a dataset


**Flow Progenitor Plots**
* Bar graphs of %  multi-potent progenitors (MPPs) and common progenitors (CPs) for two treatment groups + control
  * Individual data points plotted + bar (average) + significance level (t-test)
* Scatter plot for CFUs/g for different sample types


**PCoA and NMDS**
* PCoA and NMDS plots colored by variable (host animal and sample type) using weighted Unifrac
* Centroid distance calculations and box plots

**Mapping**
* World map with circles representing the number of samples plotted coming from a specific location
